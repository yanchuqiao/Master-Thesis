# Futher Design
## Option 1: keep the old design, do power analysis and estimate sample size
```{r}
#First, for the h1 and h2. Title are in three levels: MD, Dr, non. Gender has two level: Female and male. Six conditions in total. 15 group comparisons in total. Based on previous found, 0.6111 was the mean of Difference, and 1.1306 was the sd of difference. 
library(daewr)

round(Fpower1(alpha = 0.05, nlev = 6, nreps = 110:120, Delta = 0.6111, sigma = 1.130526), 3)
# result: at least 114 people per group to obtain at least 0.90 with family-wise significant level of 0.05. 
114*6 # at least 684 in total 

#Statement 2
round(Fpower1(alpha = 0.05, nlev = 6, nreps = 1350:1360, Delta = 0.17, sigma = 1.09), 3)

#Statement 3
round(Fpower1(alpha = 0.05, nlev = 6, nreps = 40:50, Delta = 0.87, sigma = 0.97), 3)
